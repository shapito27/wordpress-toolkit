# ThemeSniffer - WordPress Theme & Plugin Detector

Find out which WordPress theme and plugins any website uses, right from a
conversation with your AI assistant. The plugin works in Claude (claude.ai,
Cowork and Claude Code) and in ChatGPT and Codex. It connects the assistant to
the ThemeSniffer service and teaches it how to read the results: it names the
active theme (and its parent theme when a child theme is used), says whether
the theme is free, premium or custom, lists detected plugins grouped by
category such as page builders, e-commerce, SEO, forms and caching, and
compares several sites side by side.

## Use it

Ask about any public website, for example:

- "What WordPress theme does example.com use?"
- "Which plugins is this site running? https://example.com"
- "Compare the WordPress stack of site-a.com and site-b.com"

In Claude Code and Cowork you can also run the commands directly:

- `/themesniffer:sniff example.com` - detect the theme and plugins of one site
- `/themesniffer:compare site-a.com site-b.com` - compare several sites

## Setup

No account, sign-in or API key is needed.

**Claude:** install the plugin from the Claude plugin directory (or from this
repository's marketplace), then open the plugin's **Connectors** tab and
connect **ThemeSniffer**. In Claude Code, install it in one step and the
connector loads with the plugin; run `/mcp` to check that it is connected:

```
/plugin install themesniffer --marketplace shapito27/wordpress-toolkit
```

**ChatGPT and Codex:** install ThemeSniffer from the plugin directory (or add
this repository as a Codex marketplace), then mention it with `@ThemeSniffer`
in a chat.

## What the connector provides

The ThemeSniffer connector (`https://themesniffer.com/api/mcp`) offers four
read-only tools. The skills in this plugin use the first two:

- `check_if_wordpress` - WordPress verdict, confidence and the active theme
- `get_wordpress_tech_stack` - theme, plugins, hosting, CDN, server, security
  headers and a speed snapshot
- `detect_website_fonts` - the fonts a site uses
- `extract_color_palette` - a site's color palette

The service is free and rate limited per IP address; see
https://themesniffer.com/developers for the current limits.

## Data

When you ask about a website, the website address you give is sent to the
ThemeSniffer service at themesniffer.com, which fetches that public page and
returns what it detected. Nothing else from your conversation is sent. If the
ThemeSniffer connector isn't connected, the assistant can instead do a
best-effort manual check by reading the public page you named (and its theme
stylesheet) with its own web tools; nothing is sent to ThemeSniffer then. The
plugin itself runs no code on your computer and stores nothing. See the
ThemeSniffer privacy policy at https://themesniffer.com/privacy for how the
service handles requests.

## Limits

- Only plugins that leave traces on the public front end of a site can be
  detected. Backend-only plugins (backups, SMTP, admin tools) are invisible,
  and sites that bundle all their CSS and JS into one file look emptier than
  they are.
- Sites behind strict firewalls or bot protection may not be analyzable. The
  plugin then says who blocked the check rather than guessing.
- Results reflect the page at the time of the check.
